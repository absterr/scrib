**Scrib** is a real-time collaborative platform for creating, editing, and organizing documentation and notes across teams.

## Overview

A real-time collaboration tool that lets teams create, edit, and manage documentation and notes together. The application supports simultaneous multi-user editing, ensuring changes are instantly synchronized across all participants. By centralizing shared knowledge and enabling structured collaboration, it helps teams maintain clear, up-to-date documentation and work more efficiently together.

## Features

- **Collaborative editing**: Multiple users can create and edit documents simultaneously with real-time synchronization.
- **Collaborator management**: Invite, remove, and manage collaborators, with control over viewing and editing permissions.
- **AI chat**: A dedicated chat page where users can interact with AI across all notes, or reference a specific note for contextual assistance.
